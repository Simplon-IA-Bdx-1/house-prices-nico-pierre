# The House Prices Kaggle Challenge

## How to run the project

You need to download the data files from the [kaggle house prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and extract them in a *`sources/`* folder at the **root** of the project.

You need to import the `environment.yml` file in anaconda and launch the Notebook Server:

- from the command line:

  `conda activate ./env` in the working directory

- from the Anaconda Navigator:

  Environments -> Import and select the `environment.yml` file in the `./env` folder

Some variables are store in a `Pickle` jar in the folder `./jar` so you dont need to run previous notebooks to access these variables.
