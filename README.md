# The House Prices Kaggle Challenge

## How to run the project

You need to download the data files from the [kaggle house prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and extract them in a *`sources/`* folder at the **root** of the project.

You need to import the `environment.yml` file in anaconda and launch the Notebook Server.

<!-- TODO : CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT.YML FILE -->

You good to go and can now run the notebooks - The `00-data-prep.ipynb` notebook **must** come first - one by one. :)
